## 🛠️ **Build Requirements**

To build and run CyberOS, you'll need these tools:

### **Required Tools**
1. **NASM Assembler** 
   - Download: https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/
   - For x86 assembly bootloader compilation

2. **GCC Cross-Compiler** (optional but recommended)
   - For professional C compilation
   - Alternative: Any C compiler (even basic gcc)

3. **QEMU Emulator** (for running)
   - Download: https://www.qemu.org/download/
   - For x86 emulation and testing

### **Alternative Build Methods**

#### **Method 1: Full Build (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install NASM, GCC, QEMU, then:
make clean && make all && make run
```

#### **Method 2: Quick Build (Any C Compiler)**
```bash
# With any available C compiler:
nasm -f bin boot/boot.asm -o boot.bin
gcc -ffreestanding -c kernel/*.c
ld -T linker.ld -o cyberos.bin
```

#### **Method 3: Browser Preview (No Build Required)**
```bash
# Just open in web browser:
start preview.html
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Users**

### **Option A: Install Build Tools and Build**
1. **Install NASM** from https://www.nasm.us/
2. **Install GCC** (or use any C compiler)
3. **Install QEMU** for emulation
4. **Run**: `.\build_and_run.bat`

### **Option B: Experience via Browser Preview**
1. **Open** `preview.html` in any web browser
2. **Explore** all cybersecurity features interactively
3. **Learn** about the implementation without building

### **Option C: Code Study and Learning**
1. **Explore** the complete source code in `kernel/` and `include/`
2. **Study** the cybersecurity implementations
3. **Learn** from the professional OS development techniques
