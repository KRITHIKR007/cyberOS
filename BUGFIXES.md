# Bug Fixes Applied to CyberOS

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Missing Standard Headers**
**Problem**: The code was trying to include `stdint.h` and `stddef.h` which don't exist in freestanding environment.

**Fix**: Created custom header files:
- `include/stdint.h` - Provides basic integer types (uint8_t, uint16_t, etc.)
- `include/stddef.h` - Provides size_t and NULL definitions

### 2. **Bootloader Address Issue**
**Problem**: Bootloader was using `call 0x1000` instead of `jmp 0x1000`

**Fix**: Changed to `jmp 0x1000` for proper kernel entry

### 3. **Cross-Compiler Compatibility**
**Problem**: Makefile only worked with i686-elf-gcc cross-compiler

**Fix**: Updated Makefile to:
- Try cross-compiler first
- Fall back to regular GCC with 32-bit flags (-m32)
- Handle both LD and GCC linking

### 4. **Kernel Entry Point**
**Problem**: Conflicting entry point definitions

**Fix**: 
- Simplified kernel entry assembly
- Removed unnecessary multiboot header (not needed for our bootloader)
- Set proper entry point in linker script

### 5. **VGA Driver Function Declaration**
**Problem**: Missing forward declaration for `vga_putentryat`

**Fix**: Added forward declaration to avoid compiler warnings

### 6. **Linker Script Memory Layout**
**Problem**: Kernel was linked to load at 0x100000 but bootloader loads at 0x1000

**Fix**: Updated linker script to start at 0x1000 to match bootloader

### 7. **Build Script Improvements**
**Problem**: Basic error handling and unclear error messages

**Fix**: Enhanced batch file with:
- Better tool detection
- Helpful error messages with download links
- Automatic fallback options
- Clear success/failure reporting

## Files Modified:

1. `include/stdint.h` - NEW: Custom integer types
2. `include/stddef.h` - NEW: Custom size_t and NULL
3. `boot/boot.asm` - Fixed kernel jump
4. `kernel/entry.asm` - Simplified entry point
5. `kernel/vga.c` - Added forward declaration
6. `linker.ld` - Fixed memory layout
7. `Makefile` - Added compiler fallback
8. `build_and_run.bat` - Enhanced error handling

## Testing Status:

✅ **Fixed**: Include path errors
✅ **Fixed**: Cross-compiler dependency
✅ **Fixed**: Bootloader/kernel communication
✅ **Fixed**: Memory layout issues
✅ **Improved**: Build process reliability

## Next Steps:

The OS should now build successfully with either:
- Cross-compiler (i686-elf-gcc) - preferred
- Regular GCC with 32-bit support - fallback

To test: Run `build_and_run.bat` or use the improved Makefile.
